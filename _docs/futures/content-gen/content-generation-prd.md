# Content Generation System PRD

## Overview
We need a system to generate video content for Austin neighborhoods, with landmarks serving as "unlock points" in the consumer app. Each landmark unlocks access to a collection of local content videos about nearby restaurants, shops, and points of interest within walking distance.

## Success Metrics

- Generate content for 3 Austin neighborhoods (defined by central landmarks)
- For each neighborhood area:
  * 3-5 restaurant/bar videos
  * 3-5 shopping/retail videos
  * 3-5 cultural/historical videos
  * 1 landmark-specific videos
- Each video should be backed by credible local sources
- Processing time under 5 minutes per individual video

## Content Sources

We'll pull from established local voices and publications:

- Austin Chronicle neighborhood guides
- Eater Austin coverage
- Local bloggers and critics
- Historical archives for landmark content

## Processing Pipeline

### 1. Area Data Collection
A Bun script will take a landmark as an entry point and:

- Define the walkable radius/neighborhood bounds
- Identify key venues and points of interest
- Scrape relevant content for each location
- Store structured data in SQLite
- Collect public images for each venue

### 2. Content Generation

For each venue/point of interest:

- Generate focused video script
- Identify required visuals
- Create venue-specific talking points
- Package with source attribution

### 3. Video Production

Transform each content package into:

- 30-60 second focused video
- Clear narrative structure
- Location-specific visuals
- Professional voiceover

## Technical Requirements

### Storage

- Local: SQLite for processing and relationships
- Cloud: Firebase Storage for final videos

### APIs

- Perplexity API for research/fact gathering
- Firebase for asset storage
- Video generation service (TBD)

### Development

Simple Bun-served interface for:

- Managing neighborhood/venue relationships
- Content review and editing
- Process monitoring
- Asset preview

## Test Area: South Congress

Starting with South Congress Bridge as unlock point:

- Map nearby venues within walking distance
- Generate initial venue set
- Create first content collection
- Test neighborhood unlock flow

## Out of Scope

- Complex UI/UX
- Deployment infrastructure
- Multi-language support
- Advanced video effects
- Real-time updates
- User authentication
