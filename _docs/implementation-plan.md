# Detailed Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the step-by-step approach for building the Sightline MVP over three phases, corresponding to the user stories. Each phase includes specific tasks, manual configuration steps, and simple error handling strategies.

## Phase 1: Core App Features

### 1. Project Setup
- Create a new Swift project
- Initialize a new Firebase project
- Link the iOS app to Firebase via CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager
- Configure Firebase console:
  - Authentication (enable Anonymous Authentication)
  - Firestore database (with development rules)
  - Cloud Functions (for AI processing)
  - Cloud Storage

### 2. Landmark Detection
- Request camera permissions in the app's Info.plist
- Implement a camera view controller to stream video
- Integrate the Google Landmark API to detect landmarks
- Provide real-time visual feedback during detection
- Save detected "unlocked" neighborhoods in local storage (using Core Data or similar)
- On detection failure, display a user-friendly error message with an option to retry

### 3. Content Browsing
- Design a UI view that displays a video feed
- Fetch video URLs from Firebase Storage
- Integrate a video player component for smooth playback
- If video loading fails, show an alert with a retry option

### 4. Location Details
- Use the Google Places API to fetch and display location details
- Display a static map image using the Google Maps Static API
- Enable deep links to external maps for navigation
- Provide a simple error message with a retry option if location data fails to load

## Phase 2: User Accounts & Video Reviews

### 1. User Accounts
- Implement Firebase anonymous authentication
- Create a UI flow for account upgrade (email or social signup)
- Migrate any necessary local data from the anonymous session
- Display error messages with a retry option for authentication issues

### 2. Save Places
- Add a toggle control to save or unsave locations
- Persist saved locations using Firebase or local state management
- On failure, display an error message and prompt a retry

### 3. Video Reviews
- Integrate in-app video recording using native iOS APIs
- Implement video upload to Firebase Storage
- Associate the video with location data (using the Google Places API)
- If upload fails, show a clear error message with a retry option

## Phase 3: AI Features

### 1. Auto-Categorization
- Integrate a speech-to-text service for video audio analysis
- Automatically generate tags based on the extracted text
- Display the tags for user review with the option for manual editing

### 2. Upload Moderation
- Implement basic content moderation during video upload
- If a violation is detected, block the upload and display a friendly error message

### 3. Metadata Extraction
- Use entity extraction techniques to pull key details (e.g., business hours, price range)
- Present the extracted metadata to the user for confirmation and allow corrections

### 4. Non-Landmark Detection Fallback
- If the Google Landmark API fails to detect a landmark, invoke the MLLM (OpenAI GPT-4 Vision) fallback
- Display the confidence level of the fallback result
- Allow the user to confirm or retry detection if necessary
